INSTALL

Upgrade:
	
	If you are upgrading from the previous version simply run the update.sql which will add the extra
	column to the hostname table.
	
	psql fast-flux < updatedb.sql
	
	Then simply replace all the scripts that you are using instead of the previous versions
	
Fresh:

	1) Create the database tables by running the install script:	
		psql < setupdb.sql	
	2) Configure the usernames and passwords in each of the scripts with your account that you are using
	   for the database.

	You are now ready to use the system.
