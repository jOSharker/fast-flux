Version 1.1 Tracking System

This system is comprised of 3 scripts:
1. A simple import script that will take hostnames and place them into a testing table
2. A script that will take each of the hostnames in the test table and if they resolve more than 
   10 distinct IP's then it is added into the final hostname table.
3. A script that will take the hostnames from the hostname table and keep resolving the IP's adding
   in distinct IP->hostname mappings
   
   
Usage:

1. add-to-test-table.pl
	This perl script will simply take a flat file of hostnames and insert them into the hostname.
	
   perl add-to-test-table.pl [flat_file];
   
2. test_submissions.pl
	simply run as perl test_submissions.pl this purely works with what is in the test table and the
	outputs will be placed into the hostname table if they pass the thresh-hold

3. flux.pl

	Simply run this script as perl flux.pl It will continue to run forever resolving hostnames in the 
	hostname table. Every now and again it will recheck the status of hostnames that do not respond 
	aswell as only resolve the ones that we choose to track.
	
Stop tracking a designated hostname:

This may occur if you are receiving large batches of hostnames but you are getting some crap ones you no longer
want to track. like gmail's yahoo's etc. 

If you wish to stop tracking a designated hostname simply update the hostname table by doing the following:

update hostname set track = false where hostname =  '';
